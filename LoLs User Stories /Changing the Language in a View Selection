LoLs Changing the Language in a View Selection Story
====

Neil see HTML listed in the language ribbon is red. This indicates the root language
for current selection is HTML. The selection highlights a subtree of language elements.
Smaller subtrees within the selection maybe other languages than HTML, but the overall
language is indicated as HTML by being red in the language ribbon.

By clicking XML in the language ribbon, Neil changes the language for the whole subtree
in the selection to XML. If Neil instead held the shift or command key while clicking
XML only the root language of the selection would be altered.
