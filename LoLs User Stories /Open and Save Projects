Open and Save Projects
====

Having signed in to the LoLs Workbench, Bob clicks on the "open project" button
found on the project title line. This pops up a window where Bob can create a
new project or select a project from a repository. For new projects Bob enters a
project name. Bob also selects to make the project available to anyone who would
like to use it. Bob could have selected a previous created project to be opened. By
clicking the submit button the window closes and the workbench is loaded with the
project.

After entering several changes to the project Bob clicks the "save project" icon 
on the project title line. This pops up a window where Bob can change the project
name and any of the options. Bob clicks the submit botton and saves the project
to the repository.
