Add or Remove Language
====

Bob wants to use a new language, XML, in one of his project views. The language
needs to be added to the language ribbon located at the top of the LoLs
Workbench. Bob clicks the "+Language" button at the start(left top) of the
language ribbon. A window pops up which lists the available languages. Bob
selects the XML as the language to add. Languages which are on the ribbon but
are not being used in the project can be deselected. The reselected languages
are removed from the language ribbon. Several languages can be added or removed
at once. When the pop up is closed by clicking the submit button the language
ribbon is updated accordingly. Closing the pop up window or clicking the cancel 
button leaves the language ribbon unchanged.
