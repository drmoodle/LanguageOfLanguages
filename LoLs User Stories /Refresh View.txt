Refresh View
====

On the LoLs Workbench, Joe sees a refresh icon which looks like two green arrows
in a circle located on the title line for each view and also on the title line
for the project. When Joe hovers over the icon for a view, a tips pops up saying
"refresh". By clicking the icon (which is a button) the content of the current
view is redisplayed. However when Joe hovers over the icon for the project a tip 
pops up saying "refresh all". Clicking the project refresh button refreshes all 
the views in the project.
