LoLs Add View to Project Story
====

On the LoLs Workbench, Joe sees an icon which looks like an eye located on the
title line for each view. When Joe hovers over the icon, an tips pops up saying
"add view". By clicking the icon (which is a button) a duplicate of the current
view is created and added to the project. Joe can now alter the new view.
