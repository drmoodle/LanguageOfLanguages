Remove View from Project
====

On the LoLs Workbench, Joe sees an icon which is a red ball with a white X
located on the title line for each view and also on the title line for the
project. When Joe hovers over the icon, an tips pops up saying "remove view". By
clicking the icon (which is a button) the current view is removed from the
project.
