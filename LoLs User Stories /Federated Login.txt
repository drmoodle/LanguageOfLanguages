Lols Federated Login Story 
====

Nell navigates to the Language of Languages Workbench URL for the first time.
She sees a link in the upper right hand corner to "Sign In". Because she has already 
decided to be a long term user of the site, she wishes to create a user account.
The link takes her to a new web page which offers her the following choices:
     - sign in using one of the listed icons to authenticate her as a user. 
     - cancel the sign in process
Nell selects the Google Account icon. Here she would be able to create a new Google 
Account if she needed it. Because she already has a Google Account, she enters her 
user ID and password. The Google Service handles the authentication including user ID
and password recovery and other authentication issues. Once Nell's identity is verified,
the LoLs Workbench page is redisplayed. The sign in link in the upper right hand corner
is replaced with "Welcome Nell (nell@youremail.com)" followed by a sign out link. 
Clicking on the sign out link returns the workbench to the initial state.

Signing on allows Nell to save projects she creates and open other users projects who
have granted her access.
